[ ] Write a function
    [ ] that takes rows of a chessboard as arguments
    [ ] and checks if your King is "in check".
[ ] play with...
    [ ] Pawns
    [ ] Bishops
    [ ] Rooks
    [ ] Queens
    [ ] King.
[ ] A piece can only capture the first possible piece that stands on its path.
[ ] The board can be of different sizes but will remain a square.
[ ] There’s only one King and all other pieces are against it.
[ ] All the characters that are not used to refer to pieces are considered as empty squares.
[ ] The King is considered to be "in check" when an other enemy piece can capture it.  
    [ ] When it’s the case, you will print "Success" on the standard output followed by a newline
    [ ] otherwise you will print "Fail" followed by a newline.
[ ] Your function should never crash or loop indefinitely.
[ ] Whenever an undefiend behavior occurs you should return an error message or prints nothing and gives back control.
